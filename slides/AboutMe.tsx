          I am a software engineer, full-stack web developer, and VP of
          Engineering. As a child, I spent my summers in front of a computer. I
          started programming by writing TI-BASIC programs on my calculator to
          help me "cheat" on my high school physics tests. Commanding electrons
          to move the way I want to by writing in arcane languages is my
          identity. I have programmed in a wide range of languages, both
          compiled and interpreted, using many different paradigms and
          methodologies.
